Registration :
	Users cannot register to WOL application. You need to create yourself an account for them, and give them their login and password. Please, tell them they need to change their password and choose a strong one.

Connection :
	Go to the application's main page. If you cannot see the window login, it means that your web browser does not support javascript and jquery. Please, download and use a recent version of Firefox or Chromium browser.

Functionalities of users' web interface :
	With WOL, registered users can see the status, power on or turn off :
		* all the hosts linked to you by the admin
		* all the hosts in farms you are member of
		* all the groups with access level lower than access level of a group you are member of
	You have to manage these groups and farms, and to create relationships between users and hosts.

Warnings :

- The WOL application uses Cron to schedule tasks. Cron runs a script named "calledByCron.php" every minute, and this script checks if he has something to do on the current minute of the current hour, of the current day of month/week of the current months. Be careful, if you delete this line from your crontab, all the scheduled tasks will be useless.
- If the page refreshs, you are logged out. That is why the "F5" key has been handled to call a "custom" refresh function. But if you click on the "back" button of your web browser, you will be logged out.
